This is a 2D runner game where the player must jump to avoid the incoming snails. There are flies above too, so be careful!
The longer you run while avoiding the obstacles, the higher your score!

This game was written in Python and utilised the Pygame libary. It utilises the Sprite class and groupings to handle collisions between the player sprite and obstacle sprites.
The behavior of the player and enemies, as well as the player inputs are handled by methods from their corresponding Sprite classes.

The main script file and assets used are in the 'source' folder. The packaged game executable and its dependencies are in the 'game' folder.

This is my implementation of 'The ultimate introduction to Pygame' by Clear Code(https://youtu.be/AY9MnQ4x3zk).

   ----  HOW TO RUN THE GAME ----
1. Download the 'game' folder and all of its contents.
2. Run the 'Runner.exe' file inside the game folder.
3. Have fun!
